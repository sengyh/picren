# picren
Picren helps you rename and reorganise your photos by date and location.\
Simply provide a valid folder or photo that you'd like to convert and a valid folder to place and create your very own picren-ified library.

### Current (and default) functionality 
  **Organisation**:
  > Photos are moved to the destination folder and placed in a hierarchical order based on the address  
  from the top down (country -> state/city)
    
  **Naming**:
  > Photos will be renamed (in this order) to the date, time and location (if present) 
    when/where the photo was taken.
